# Coordinate Systems
**Coordinate systems** [📖](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvBlekYhch0ST9c-YsfEXxw-ffOiXB6U0lUfBnZ4zq0/edit?usp=sharing) are systems for visually representing information along numerical axes, which are called **dimensions**. Enabling us for the first time to represent algebraic equations graphically as shapes – such as lines, curves, parabolas, or circles – giving these equations a geometric form for the first time.

>In physics and mathematics, coordinate systems are incredibly useful. We can use them to accurately define position and thus other quantities such as displacement, or direction of movement which are related to position and require an accurate initial measurement (along with any other vectors where direction is important) with precision. So we can use coordinate systems to **orientate ourselves or an event in physical space** and so describe it accurately, and to visualize, analyze and understand the interaction deeply. Or we can use them **to plot data** which has been quantified against other sets of data, or to **plot quantities** as functions of other quantities.

## Cartesian Coordinates
The **Cartesian or the fundamental coordinate system** [📖](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvBlekYhch0ST9c-YsfEXxw-ffOiXB6U0lUfBnZ4zq0/edit?usp=sharing) is a powerful tool to accurately define position and thus help other quantities which rely on accurate initial measurements. So, we can use coordinate systems to accurately visualize and understand what function are and how they behave. 

>Cartesian coordinates are the **foundation of analytic geometry**, and provide enlightening geometric interpretations for many other branches of *mathematics*, such as linear algebra, complex analysis, differential geometry, multivariate calculus, group theory and more. A familiar example is the concept of the graph of a function. Cartesian coordinates are also essential tools for most applied disciplines that deal with geometry, including *astronomy, physics, engineering and many more*. They are the most common coordinate system used in *computer graphics, computer-aided geometric design and other geometry-related data processing*

### 1-D Coordinate system
<img align= "right"  src="https://github.com/cpawley/HHG2-MSP-Physics/blob/master/SadVries_images/1-D.png?raw=true">

Plotting on 1 dimension means only plotting on **one axis** , creating a number line. A number line assigns an origin (0) for reference and then positive and negative number on either side.  An example of its use is *plotting a motion* for example a person walking. 


>You don’t only need to plot motion on a number line. You can turn it vertically and *plot changes in temperature*, which means that a thermometer is an example of a number line. Or, the practice of *measuring your child’s height over the years on a door frame* is the plotting of their height data on a number line.

### 2-D Coordinate system
<img align= "right"  src="https://github.com/cpawley/HHG2-MSP-Physics/blob/master/SadVries_images/2-D.png?raw=true">

A 2-dimensional plot **adds one axis to our 1-dimensional coordinate system**. Now we label de axis and call the horizontal axis x and the vertical y. A 2-s coordinate system has its origin where the x and y axis intersect. The axis basically split up the coordinate system into 4 quadrants named quadrant + a roman numeral accordingly. To define a point on the coordinate system we use the format (x, y). So point a on figure a is (4, 5) with 4 being the value on the x-axis and 5 on the y-axis. 2d coordinate system has a multitude of uses like plotting movement on a terrain from a birds-eye view. 

>In addition, for example, *in astrophysics* in what is known as the Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram the surface temperature of stars is plotted against their luminosity from which *we derive all sorts of fascinating information about stars*, their life cycles, stellar structure, and so on.

### 3-D Coordinate system 
<img align= "right"  src="https://github.com/cpawley/HHG2-MSP-Physics/blob/master/SadVries_images/3-D.png?raw=true">

To get a 3-d coordinate system you **add another axis to your x- and y-axis called the z-axis** and thus adding a 3rd dimension. With 3-axis we can measure *any type movement in space* because are system now is able to describe the 6 degrees of freedom that an object has.

>It is **the most comprehensive system for describing position and motion**: 
>If we were describing physical reality with our coordinate system, then we would now be describing height, width, and depth, which is the form that reality exists in which is why we say that we live in a 3-D world.

>For example, imagine there was a bird hovering 5 meters in front of us, 3 meters in the air, and directly in our line of sight. From that description of it’s position we could then assign it very specific (x, y, z) coordinates relative to our position in our coordinate system. We could say that “The bird was hovering at coordinates (0, 3, 5)!” which our friend could understand as us saying that it was 3 meters in the air, 5 meters in front of us directly in our line of sight

## Spherical coordinate system
<img align= "right"  src="https://github.com/cpawley/HHG2-MSP-Physics/blob/master/SadVries_images/Spherical-description.png?raw=true">


>Some surfaces, can be difficult to model with equations based on the Cartesian system. Spherical coordinates are useful for dealing with *problems involving spheres*, such as finding the volume of domed structures.
> -Mathematics LibreTexts

The **spherical coordinate system** [📖](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvBlekYhch0ST9c-YsfEXxw-ffOiXB6U0lUfBnZ4zq0/edit?usp=sharing) describes a point in three-dimensional space. The position is described by three numbers: **radial distance (r), polar angle (θ) and azimuthal angle (φ)**. The spherical coordinate system is mostly used for solving problems that deal with spherical symmetry like gravity of a Planet.

- r, the radial distance, radius or radial coordinate is the **distance from the origin to the point**. 
- θ is the **angle counter-clockwise** from polar or positive x-axis in the xy-plane. The polar angle is also called colatitude, zenith angle, normal angle, or inclination angle 
- φ is the **angle between the positive z-axis and the point**

what the spherical coordinate system does is map a point on a sphere with radius r. then determine with angle θ how far along a circle it lies that is part of a sphere and then determine the height of that circle with angle φ. By clicking [Here](https://mathinsight.org/spherical_coordinates) you can find a live model in which you can tweak r, θ, φ in order to change the point on the sphere.<br>

## Coordinate Conversions
An advantage of having these different kinds of coordinate systems is that if you for example find a spherical symmetry in a 3D Cartesian coordinate system you are able to convert them quite easily to spherical in order to *make certain calculations easier*. Down below you will find tables that have the conversion in them.

For some practise you can use this link from [math.libretexts.org](https://math.libretexts.org/Courses/Monroe_Community_College/MTH_212_Calculus_III/Chapter_11%3A_Vectors_and_the_Geometry_of_Space/11.7%3A_Cylindrical_and_Spherical_Coordinates)

The tables below include **Cylindrical coordinates**  [📖](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvBlekYhch0ST9c-YsfEXxw-ffOiXB6U0lUfBnZ4zq0/edit?usp=sharing) which were not previously mentioned. The concept is similar to the one of spherical coordinates.
>Cylindrical coordinates are useful for dealing with *problems involving cylinders*, such as calculating the volume of a round water tank or the amount of oil flowing through a pipe.

## Del operator on different coordinate systems
To *process data found in experiments* one might want to use mathematical operations in order to analyse data. The **del** [📖](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvBlekYhch0ST9c-YsfEXxw-ffOiXB6U0lUfBnZ4zq0/edit?usp=sharing) formulas are incredibly usefull for analysing systems, but  their formulas differ for coordinate systems. Below is a table which has some of the formulas that are used frequently.

>Del is used as a shorthand form to *simplify many long mathematical expressions*
